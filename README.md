- [X] 4. Add an ordered list of tasks with `id="task-list"`.

- [X] 6. Sort the items in the task list by order of creation.
- [X] 7. Clicking on a list item should change the background color of the item to `rgb(128,128,128) gray`.
- [X] 8. It should not be possible to select more than one element in the list at a time.

- [X] 11. Add a button with `id="remove-finalized"` that when clicked removes only the finalized elements from your list.
